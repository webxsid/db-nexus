# DB Nexus -- Daily Progress Log
--- 

The file is a chronological record of daily progress on a single project. It serves two purposes:
	1.	Private Development Journal – Keeps a granular record of your daily work, experiments, and thought process.
	2.	Source for Public Updates – Makes it easy to compile blog posts, portfolio updates, or changelogs without rewriting from scratch.

Each daily entry should capture:
	•	What was done – features, bug fixes, experiments.
	•	Why it was done – decisions, trade-offs, and rationale.
	•	What’s next – clear next steps to keep momentum.
	•	Context for future you – so when you look back weeks later, the notes still make sense.

### Document Rendering Enhancements
- Finalized approach for per-type rendering in document viewer:
  - Dates → `moment-timezone` formatting with user-selected timezone label.
  - ObjectId references → planned “jump to document” support for faster navigation.
  - Strings → raw view vs parsed view based on display style.
- Added validation flow for date parsing:
  - Strict ISO check, fallback to loose parse.
  - Invalid values displayed as prettified JSON.
- Considered context menu actions per key:
  - “Add to Filter”
  - “Copy Path”
  - “Jump to Reference”
- Discussed expanding/collapsing nested objects/arrays for large documents.

### Feature Exploration – URL Content Type Detection
- Explored detecting URL value types to improve UX (e.g., show preview for images, docs).
- Considered `HEAD` request to get `Content-Type` before rendering.
- Risks & concerns:
  - Performance hit if checking all URLs automatically.
  - Privacy concerns (may ping external domains without user intent).
  - Some servers may block or misreport content type.
- Potential approach:
  - Manual trigger via context menu (“Check URL Type”).
  - Lazy fetch only on hover or click.
  - Local cache for repeated lookups in same collection.

### UX / Design Considerations
- Goal: Make document viewing feel native and context-rich without over-fetching.
- Avoid clutter in the right pane by grouping contextual actions into a single menu.
- Ensure large nested documents remain performant with progressive rendering.

### Decisions & Rationale
- No auto-fetch for URL previews in initial release → start with manual check.
- Store preview type results locally for session to avoid repeated network calls.
- Keep rendering system modular so additional value-type handlers can be added later.

### Next Steps
- Prototype `checkUrlContentType(url)` helper.
- Add context menu integration for URL type check.
- Implement expand/collapse for nested structures.
- Start scaffolding ObjectId reference navigation flow.

### Notes
- Need to finalize how to handle embedded binary data (GridFS files) in viewer.
- Consider adding developer-facing toggle for “debug rendering mode” to inspect raw data vs parsed output.
